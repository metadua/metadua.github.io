We are a data analytics focused company that employs the science of examining raw data with the purpose of drawing conclusions about that information. This technique can be used in many industries to allow companies and organizations to make better business decisions and in the sciences to verify or disprove existing models or theories.

We will be using various open source technologies to help automate all the processes involved in data analytics from end to end. Please do get used to the tools (and programming languages) we will be using here if you intend to follow us down this rabbit hole.

List of tools:
